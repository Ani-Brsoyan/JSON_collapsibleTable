## README

This project aims to show how to create simple collapsible HTML tables from JSON data. 
There are three JSON files and each contains JSON tree-based info. For each file three sectioned table is created (via recursive function call).

No need for additional activations and/or imports. Just run LiveServer on you VS Code.

Happy Coding!
